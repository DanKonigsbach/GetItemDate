    <h1>How to get the date a photo was taken (programmatically)</h1>
    <p>
        When someone has a large photograph collection, one natural way
        to organize the photos is by the date that the photo was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the photos are not organized that way, it's
        natural to consider making a script to move them into folders based on the
        date they were taken.
    </p>
    <p>
        It <i>seems</i> like getting the date taken ought to be easy. Lots of
        programs do that for you. If you look at the image properties, it's right there.
        How hard can it be?
    </p>
    <p>
        Not as straightforward as you might expect. If you try to use Windows APIs to get the date taken,
        you'll likely run into a bunch of dead ends and frustrations. Thats why you'll find lots of posted questions
        asking how to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll try to help you avoid some of those frustrations.
    </p>
    <h2>ExifTool</h2>
    <p>The usual recommendation for getting the date that a photo was taken is to use <a href="https://ExifTool.org/" target="_blank">ExifTool, from Phil Harvey</a>.</p>
    <p>
        ExifTool is a fantastic utility for getting, and even setting, image metadata. Extracting the date that an image was
        taken is a piece of cake and barely scratches the surface of what ExifTool can do. It's very powerful and extremely flexible.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the newcomer, ExifTool's options can be daunting. If what you want is it to return the date that an image was taken, here is how to do it:
    </p>
    <h3>How to get ExifTool</h3>
    <p>
        If you don't already have ExifTool, download it from <a href="https://exiftool.org/">here</a>.  You will almost certainly want to install it some place in your PATH
        (or add whereever you choose to install it to your PATH). When you install it, you'll have an executable named ExifTool(-k).
        (In Windows, that will be ExifTool(-k).exe.) That automatically provides the "-k" option, which is very useful for interactive work. For a script, though,
        it just gets into the way. You will want to either rename the executable or make a copy in the same directory without the "(-k)", for example, in Windows,
        ExifTook.exe. Now, you're ready to use it as a command line utility.
    </p>
    <h3>How to use ExifTool to get the image date (and nothing else)</h3>
    <p>Your command to extract the date an image was taken will look something like this:</p>
    <code class="syntax">
        ExifTool.exe -CreateDate -s3 -d "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" <i>filename</i>
    </code>
    <p>where:</p>
    <table class="paramdescr">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th><p><nobr><code>-CreateDate</code></nobr></p></th>
                <td>
                    <p>Asks ExifTool to return the date that the image was created.</p>
                    <p>
                        ExifTool can extract lots of attributes from an image file. Each of those attributes has a name, which the ExifTool documentation refers to as a TAG.
                        You can select individual attributes by putting -TAG on the command line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The TAG <code>CreateDate</code> will give you the date and time that the image was taken. Although there are other TAGs wil similar, closely related information,
                        <code>CreateDate</code> has
                        the benefit of working for both images and videos.
                    </p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th><p><nobr><code>-s3</code></nobr></p></th>
                <td>
                    <p>Suppresses the output of the tag name</p>
                    <p>
                        ExifTool normally labels the values it extracts, and can do so in a wide variety of useful formats. But if you are writing a script and you just want
                        the plain, unadorned value, you can specify <code>-s3</code>, which means "short-short-short", to get that.
                    </p>
                    <p>Other format options include JSON (<code>-j</code>), XML (<code>-X</code>), CSV (<code>-csv</code>), HTML (<code>-h</code>), and plenty others.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th><p><nobr><code>-d</code></nobr></p></th>
                <td>
                    <p>Lets you control the format of a datetime output.</p>
                    <p>examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>-d "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"</code> gives you a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS</li>
                        <li><code>-d "%Y-%m-%d"</code> gives you a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD</li>
                        <li><code>-d "%Y:%m:%d"</code> gives you a date in the format YYYY:MM:DD</li>

                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>GetItemDate</h2>
    <p>
        ExifTool is a very powerful and flexible tool. Not surprisingly, it has a fairly heavy installation footprint. For a simple script, that could be
        burdensome. GetItemDate is a small, self-contained Windows utility that does just the job of getting and formatting the date that an
        image or video was taken.
    </p>
    <p>You can find GetItemDate in GitHub, where you can download <a href="https://github.com/DanKonigsbach/GetItemDate/releases/">a compiled executable</a> or <a href="https://github.com/DanKonigsbach/GetItemDate">download the source code</a> and build it yourself.</p>
    <p>Run GetItemDate by itself to see the command-line options it offers.</p>
    <p>Full instructions on how to use it are on the <a href="https://github.com/DanKonigsbach/GetItemDate">GitHub page</a>.</p>
