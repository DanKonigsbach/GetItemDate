    <h1>How to get the date a photo was taken (programmatically)</h1>
    <p>When someone has a large photograph collection, one natural way 
    to organize the photos is by the date that the photo was taken.</p>
    <p>If the photos are not organized that way, it's
    natural to consider making a script to move them into folders based on the 
    date they were taken. </p>
    <p>It <i>seems</i> like getting the date taken ought to be easy. Lots of 
    programs do that for you. If you look at the image properties, it's right there.
    How hard can it be?</p>
    <p>As lots of posted questions demonstrate, it's not as straightforward as one might 
        expect. That's why I wrote a small utility program, GetItemDate, to fetch and format it. It 
        solved my problem, and you are welcome to use it, too.
